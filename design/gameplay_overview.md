# Pregame City – Gameplay Overview (Challenge-First)

Core fantasy: a sports-obsessed city where players run around together but
each field/court is an **arcade-style solo challenge station**.

Loop:
1. Explore city districts (Court Street, Central Pitch, etc.).
2. Walk up to a field marker.
3. HUD shows `[E] Start Challenge`.
4. Play a 30–60s shooting/skill challenge.
5. Earn XP + coins based on performance.
6. Spend coins on cosmetics and vehicles.

No team-vs-team rules in v1 – just solo challenges in a shared world.
